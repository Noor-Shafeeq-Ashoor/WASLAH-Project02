### Authentication

Protected endpoints require a valid JWT access token.

The token should be provided using the HTTP `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
```

Public endpoints do not require authentication.

### Access Levels

* **Public** — No authentication required.
* **Authenticated User** — Requires a valid JWT token.
* **Employer** — Requires a valid JWT token and `EMPLOYER` role.
* **Café Manager** — Requires a valid JWT token and `CAFE_MANAGER` role.

### Swagger / OpenAPI

WASLAH uses Swagger/OpenAPI to provide interactive API documentation.

After starting the application, Swagger UI is available at:

```text
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
```

Swagger provides detailed information about:

* Available API endpoints
* HTTP methods
* Endpoint descriptions
* Path parameters
* Query parameters
* Request bodies
* Response bodies
* HTTP status codes
* Authentication requirements
* JWT Bearer authentication
* Role-based access requirements

### Using JWT Authentication in Swagger

1. Register a user using `/auth/register`.
2. Log in and obtain a JWT token.
3. Open Swagger UI.
4. Click the **Authorize** button.
5. Enter the JWT token using the Bearer authentication scheme.
6. Execute protected endpoints directly from Swagger UI.

Example:

```text
Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...
```

### API Response Status Codes
